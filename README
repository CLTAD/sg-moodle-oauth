A simple Single Sign-On OAuth server implementation for Moodle 2.

This is a beta release and has been tested on Moodle 2.0.4 to Moodle 2.1.1.

This version doesn't have a user interface for creating consumer data so you'll need to insert directly into the database.
This package provides sample consumer client implementations for elgg and wordpress.

See server/INSTALL for instructions on how to install the server component in Moodle.
See consumer/elgg/INSTALL if you want to SSO to an elgg installation.
See consumer/wordpress/INSTALL if you want to SSO to a wordpress installation.
